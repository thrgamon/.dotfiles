Programs
--------

* [rcup(1)][rcup1] is the main program. It is used to install and update
  dotfiles, with support for tags, host-specific files, and multiple source
  directories.
* [rcdn(1)][rcdn1] is the opposite of [rcup(1)][rcup1].
* [mkrc(1)][mkrc1] is for introducing a dotfile into your dotfiles directory,
  with support for tags and multiple source directories.
* [lsrc(1)][lsrc1] shows you all your dotfiles and where they would be
  symlinked to. It is used by [rcup(1)][rcup1] but is provided for your own
  use, too.
